📈 Stock Market Prediction Model
This repository contains a Stock Market Prediction model built using Machine Learning techniques. 
The project involves data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation,
and prediction for stock prices based on historical data.

🚀 Features

📊 Historical Stock Data Collection

🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

🏗️ Machine Learning Model Creation (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

📈 Model Evaluation (MSE, RMSE, R² Score)

🔮 Future Stock Price Prediction

📉 Visualization of Results

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 🐍

Jupyter Notebook 📓

Libraries:

pandas

numpy
